            <h2>Mental Health - WHO Research</h2>
            <p>Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It has intrinsic and instrumental value and is integral to our well-being.</p>

            <p>At any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community and structural factors may combine to protect or undermine mental health. Although most people are resilient, people who are exposed to adverse circumstances – including poverty, violence, disability and inequality – are at higher risk of developing a mental health condition.</p>
           

            <p>Many mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively low cost, yet health systems remain significantly under-resourced and treatment gaps are wide all over the world. Mental health care is often poor in quality when delivered. People with mental health conditions often also experience stigma, discrimination and human rights violations.</p> 
            <h3>Impact</h3>


            <p>Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning or risk of self-harm.

                In 2019, 970 million people globally were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depression the most common.
                
                Mental health conditions can cause difficulties in all aspects of life, including relationships with family, friends and community. They can result from or lead to problems at school and at work.
                
                Globally, mental disorders account for 1 in 6 years lived with disability. People with severe mental health conditions die 10 to 20 years earlier than the general population. And having a mental health condition increases the risk of suicide and experiencing human rights violations.
                
                The economic consequences of mental health conditions are also enormous, with productivity losses significantly outstripping the direct costs of care.</p>

            <h2>Bipolar Disorder & Genetic Studies - NIMH</h2>
            <p>The largest genome-wide study of people with bipolar disorder sheds new light on the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms involved in this common and often disabling mental illness. The findings from the study, funded by the National Institute of Health, may pave the way for more targeted and personalized treatments that could improve the lives of people with bipolar disorder.</p>

            <p>The results revealed an over four-fold increase in the number of genes associated with bipolar disorder, identifying nearly 300 gene locations and 36 unique genes most likely to be linked to the disorder. Many of these genes overlapped with those previously implicated in the risk for other mental disorders such as schizophrenia and depression.The next big challenge for the field is to understand why bipolar disorder varies so much from person to person and the degree to which genetic factors can explain individual variation.</p>

            <p>Beyond genetics, NIMH research also explores environmental triggers such as stress, trauma, and lifestyle factors that can worsen bipolar disorder. By combining genetic research with real-world data, scientists aim to develop more effective treatment plans, from medication adjustments to personalized therapy approaches.</p>
